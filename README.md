# Challenge-5 


# Instructions
    Access the given data from a recent animal study and compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest against other treatments.
    You will need to clean the data and generate summany statistics.

# Prep the Data
    You will need to create a new DataFrame where mouse duplicated are removed from the data.

# Summary Statistic
    You need to produce the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and sem of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

# Bar and Pie charts 
    For the bar charts you will need to create a chart that shows the total number of timepoints for all mice tested.
    For the pie charts you will need to create a chart that shows the male vs female distribution.

# Quartiles and Box Plot
    The next part of the challenge you will need to create a new DataFrame that has the last timepoint fo each mouse ID.
    After that, you then need to put all four treatment group into a list and fill the list with tumor volume data.
    The final step is to use a for loop to display the IQR and outliers for each gorup, then generate a box plot to show the distribution.

# Line and Scatter Plot
    In this section of the assignment you need to generate a line plot to show the tumor volume vs the time point of one particular mouse teated with Capomulin.
    For the scatter plot you need to generate a plot that shows the average tumor volume vs the mouse weight for Capomulin reginem.

# Correlation and Regression
    In the final part of the module you are tasked with calculating the correlation coefficient and creating a linear regression model.

# My aid through this module challenge
    Overall, this was a very tough challenge for me. To start I used my tutor session to aid me in the summary statistics.
    After getting done with my tutor session, I still had some issues completing the rest of the assignment. 
    Using the ask BCS as well as looking over previous class work tasks was very helpful for most of the charts.
